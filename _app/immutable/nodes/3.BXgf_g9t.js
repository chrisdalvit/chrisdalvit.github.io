            Currently, I am pursuing a Master&#39;s degree at the University of Trento,

            I earned Bachelor&#39;s degrees in Computer Science and Philosophy from the University of Innsbruck. 
            During my time there, I was particularly interested in logic, formal verification (mainly using Isabelle/HOL), 
            epistemology, and the philosophy of science.</p> <p class="svelte-kz2yc7">If you&#39;d like to connect, feel free to reach out via email, or you can find me on GitHub and LinkedIn.</p>`;return{c(){e=g("div"),e.innerHTML=n,this.h()},l(t){e=_(t,"DIV",{class:!0,slot:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),$(e)!=="svelte-13z1kr3"&&(e.innerHTML=n),this.h()},h(){a(e,"class","content svelte-kz2yc7"),a(e,"slot","center")},m(t,s){v(t,e,s)},p:c,d(t){t&&I(e)}}}function C(o){let e,n;return e=new k({props:{$$slots:{center:[z]},$$scope:{ctx:o}}}),{c(){u(e.$$.fragment)},l(t){p(e.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,s){f(e,t,s),n=!0},p(t,[s]){const r={};s&1&&(r.$$scope={dirty:s,ctx:t}),e.$set(r)},i(t){n||(d(e.$$.fragment,t),n=!0)},o(t){h(e.$$.fragment,t),n=!1},d(t){y(e,t)}}}class x extends l{constructor(e){super(),m(this,e,null,C,i,{})}}export{x as component};
